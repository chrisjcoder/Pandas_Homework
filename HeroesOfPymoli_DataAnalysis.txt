Here are a few of observable trends based on the data:

Gender Demographics:

Disproprotionate percent of male players. 
Action: How do we improve marketing strategy and/or product to target more women players, thus increasing total players.

Age Demographics:

20-24:44.79%
15-19: 18.58%
25-29: 13.37%

Data has provided our best target age demographic of 20-24 yrs of age.
Should increase marketing strategy for 20-24 range,and possibly increase visibility in the 15-19 bracket.
Would be interesting the percentage of gender within the 20-24 age bracket.

Most Popular/Profitable:

Deeper analysis should be done to analyze characteristics of most profitable or popular products and replicate to other item offerings.
